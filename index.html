<h1> Coriander </h1> 
</div>

<h3> Coriander (/ˌkɒriˈændər, ˈkɒriændər/; Coriandrum sativum) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant">annual herb</a> in the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiaceae">Apiaceae</a>. It is also known as <i>Chinese parsley</i> or <i>dhania</i>, and in the United States the stems and leaves are usually called <i>cilantro</i> (/sɪˈlæntroʊ, -ˈlɑːn-/). All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds (as a spice) are the parts most traditionally used in cooking.
Most people perceive the taste of coriander leaves as a tart, lemon/lime taste, but depending on ethnicity, 3–21% of people tested think the leaves taste like dish soap, linked to a gene which detects some specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehydes">aldehydes</a> that are also used as odorant substances in many soaps and detergents. </h3>

<h2> Origin </h2>

	<h3> Coriander grows wild over a wide area of <i>Western Asia</i> and <i>Southern Europe</i>, prompting the comment: <i>"It is hard to define exactly where this plant is wild and where it only recently established itself."</i> Fifteen desiccated mericarps were found in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B level of the Nahal Hemar Cave in Israel, which may be the oldest archaeological find of coriander. About half a litre of coriander mericarps was recovered from the tomb of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamen">Tutankhamen</a>, and because this plant does not grow wild in Egypt, Zohary and Hopf interpret this find as proof that coriander was cultivated by the ancient Egyptians.
Coriander seems to have been cultivated in Greece since at least the second millennium BC. One of the <abbr title="Linear B is a syllabic script that was used for writing Mycenaean Greek, the earliest attested form of Greek.">Linear B</abbr> tablets recovered from Pylos refers to the species as being cultivated for the manufacture of perfumes; it apparently was used in two forms: as a spice for its seeds and as a herb for the flavour of its leaves. This appears to be confirmed by archaeological evidence from the same period; the large quantities of the species retrieved from an Early Bronze Age layer at Sitagroi in Macedonia could point to cultivation of the species at that time.</h3>

<h2> Botanical description </h2>
	<h3> Coriander is native to regions spanning from Southern Europe and Northern Africa to Southwestern Asia. It is a soft plant growing to 50 cm (20 in) tall. The leaves are variable in shape, broadly lobed at the base of the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems. The flowers are borne in small umbels, white or very pale pink, asymmetrical, with the petals pointing away from the center of the umbel longer (5–6 mm or 0.20–0.24 in) than those pointing toward it (only 1–3 mm or 0.039–0.118 in long). The fruit is a globular, dry <abbr title="A schizocarp is a dry fruit that, when mature, splits up into mericarps.">schizocarp</abbr> 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) in diameter. Pollen size is approximately 33 microns. </h3>

<h2> Uses </h2>
	<h3>All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the parts most traditionally used in cooking, Coriander is used in cuisines throughout the world.</h3>

<h2> Leaves </h2>
	<h3> The leaves are variously referred to as coriander leaves, fresh coriander, dhania, Chinese parsley, or (in the US and commercially in Canada) cilantro.</h3>
	<h3>Coriander potentially may be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culantro">culantro</a> (Eryngium foetidum L.), in the same family (Apiaceae) as coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), but from a different genus. Culantro has a distinctly different spiny appearance, a more potent volatile leaf oil and a stronger aroma. </h3>
	<h3>The leaves have a different taste from the seeds, with citrus overtones.</h3>
	<h3> The fresh leaves are an ingredient in many foods, such as <abbr title="The term chutney refers to a number of sauces native to the Indian subcontinent, forming an integral part of the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent.">chutneys</abbr> and salads, <abbr title="(in Spanish) means sauce.">salsa</abbr>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guacamole">guacamole</a>, and as a widely-used garnish for soup, fish and meat. As heat diminishes their flavour, coriander leaves are often used raw or added to the dish immediately before serving. In Indian and Central Asian recipes, coriander leaves are used in large amounts and cooked until the flavour diminishes. The leaves spoil quickly when removed from the plant, and lose their aroma when dried or frozen. </h3>
	
<h2> Seeds </h2>
	<h3> The dry fruits are known as coriander seeds. The word "coriander" in food preparation may refer solely to these seeds (as a spice), rather than to the plant. The seeds have a lemony citrus flavour when crushed, due to terpenes linalool and pinene. It is described as <i>warm, nutty, spicy, and orange-flavoured</i>.</h3>
	<h3> The variety <i>C. s. vulgare</i> has a fruit diameter of 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in), while <i>var. C. s. microcarpum</i> fruits have a diameter of 1.5–3 mm (0.06–0.12 in). Large-fruited types are grown mainly by tropical and subtropical countries, e.g. Morocco, India, and Australia, and contain a low volatile oil content (0.1-0.4%). They are used extensively for grinding and blending purposes in the spice trade. Types with smaller fruit are produced in temperate regions and usually have a volatile oil content around 0.4-1.8%, so are highly valued as a raw material for the preparation of essential oil. </h3>
	
<h2> Roots </h2>
<h3> Coriander roots have a deeper, more intense flavor than the leaves, and are used in a variety of Asian cuisines, especially in Thai dishes such as soups or <abbr title="Thai curry refers both to dishes in Thai cuisine that are made with various types of curry paste and to the pastes themselves. A Thai curry dish is made from curry paste, coconut milk or water, meat, seafood, vegetables or fruit, and herbs.">curry pastes</abbr>. </h3>

<h2> Nutrition </h2>
	<h3> Raw coriander leaves are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and less than 1% fat. The nutritional profile of coriander seeds is different from the fresh stems or leaves. In a 100 gram reference amount, leaves are particularly rich in vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin K, with moderate content of dietary minerals. Although seeds generally have lower content of vitamins, they do provide significant amounts of dietary fiber, calcium, selenium, iron, magnesium and manganese. </h3>

<h2> Taste and smell </h2>
	<h3> The essential oil from coriander leaves and seeds contains mixed <i>polyphenols and terpenes</i>, including <abbr title="Linalool refers to two enantiomers of a naturally occurring terpene alcohol found in many flowers and spice plants.">linalool</abbr> as the major constituent accounting for the aroma and flavor of coriander.</h3>
	<h3> <b>Different people may perceive the taste of coriander leaves differently.</b> Those who enjoy it say it has a <i>refreshing, lemony</i> or <i>lime-like flavor</i>, while those who dislike it have a strong aversion to its pungent taste and smell, characterizing it as soapy or rotten. </h3>
	<h3> Studies also show variations in preference among different ethnic groups: 21% of East Asians, 17% of Caucasians, and 14% of people of African descent expressed a dislike for coriander, but among the groups where coriander is popular in their cuisine, only 7% of South Asians, 4% of Hispanics, and 3% of Middle Eastern subjects expressed a dislike. </h3>
	<h3> Studies have shown that 80% of identical twins shared the same preference for the herb, but fraternal twins agreed only about half the time, strongly suggesting a genetic component to the preference. In a genetic survey of nearly 30,000 people, two genetic variants linked to perception of coriander have been found, the most common of which is a gene involved in sensing smells. The gene, OR6A2, lies within a cluster of olfactory-receptor genes, and encodes a receptor that is highly sensitive to aldehyde chemicals. Flavor chemists have found that the coriander aroma is created by a half-dozen or so substances, and most of these are aldehydes. Those who dislike the taste are sensitive to the offending unsaturated aldehydes and at the same time may be unable to detect the aromatic chemicals that others find pleasant. Association between its taste and several other genes, including a bitter-taste receptor, have also been found. </h3>

<h2> Allergy </h2>
	<h3> Some people are allergic to coriander leaves or seeds, having symptoms similar to those of other food allergies. In one study examining people suspected of food allergies to spices, 32% of <abbr title="Skin allergy testing or skin prick test (SPT) is a method for medical diagnosis of allergies that attempts to provoke a small, controlled, allergic response.">pin-prick</abbr> tests in children and 23% in adults were positive for coriander and other members of the family <i>Apiaceae</i>, including caraway, fennel, and celery. The allergic symptoms may be minor or life-threatening. </h3>
